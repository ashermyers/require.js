# require.js
requirejs: an extremely simple way of organizing variables and modules in javascript.


## Syntax:

`Defining a function.`
`define("whateveryouwant", function (e){return e;})`

`Executing a function.`
`execute("whateveryouwant")("Hello World!")`

## Why did you create this?
I found that javascript modules weren't as organized as I wanted them to be and I created the simplest solution possible.
